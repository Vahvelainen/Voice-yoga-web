  // Check that users feet are visible
  // if not, advice to tilt the device more upright

  // 3.
  // Check that shoulders or head is in frame
  // if not advice user to walk further away from the device

  // 4.
  // Check that user is more or less horizontally centered
  // Advice to walk bit to left or bit to right

  // 5. Check that shoulderline points a bit away from the camera but not rearwards
  // addvice to turn if not
